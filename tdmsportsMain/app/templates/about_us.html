                <h2>Company</h2>
                <p>Established in the year 2001 by Tyler de Mier, TDM Sports has long been established as the leading
                    Basque specialist retailer of fashionable branded, sports and casual wear. What started as a single
                    shop in Bilbao, Biscay has now expanded across the Basque Country, and by 2006, TDM Sports has
                    opened a total of 56 stores. By 2011, TDM Sports has dominated most of the EU, primarily in Germany,
                    Ireland, France, Netherlands and Spain, with Denmark and Sweden to follow suit. At this moment in
                    time, TDM Sports was already regarded as the most innovative visual merchandiser of sportswear with
                    the best
                    and most exclusive stylish range.
                    <br><br>
                    Fast forward to 2016, TDM Sports officially launched its first store in Asia, right here in
                    Malaysia. In
                    November, TDM Sports opened its first flagship store in Pavilion Elite, Kuala Lumpur, and its third
                    store in
                    Asia in Sunway Velocity, Cheras.
                    <br><br>
                    TDM Sports looks forward to a progressive development in Asia in the days to come.</p>
